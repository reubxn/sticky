# Instinct

An AI teacher that lives as a buddy next to your cursor. It can see your screen, talk to you, and even point at stuff. Kinda like having a real teacher next to you.

## Manual setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.2+ (for ScreenCaptureKit)
- Xcode 15+
- Node.js 18+ (for the Cloudflare Worker)
- A [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account (free tier works)
- API keys for: [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com), [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com), [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io)

### 1. Set up the Cloudflare Worker

The Worker is a tiny proxy that holds your API keys. The app talks to the Worker, the Worker talks to the APIs. This way your keys never ship in the app binary.

```bash
cd worker
npm install
```

Now add your secrets. Wrangler will prompt you to paste each one:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
```

For the ElevenLabs voice ID, open `wrangler.toml` and set it there (it's not sensitive):

```toml
[vars]
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID = "your-voice-id-here"
```

Deploy it:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

It'll give you a URL like `https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`. Copy that.

### 2. Run the Worker locally (for development)

If you want to test changes to the Worker without deploying:

```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler dev
```

This starts a local server (usually `http://localhost:8787`) that behaves exactly like the deployed Worker. Copy `worker/.dev.vars.example` to `worker/.dev.vars` and fill in your keys:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=...
```

The checked-in app config points `WorkerBaseURL` at `http://localhost:8787` for local development. For a deployed Worker, update `WorkerBaseURL` in `leanring-buddy/Info.plist` to your `workers.dev` URL.

### 3. Update the proxy URLs in the app

The app reads assistant API URLs from `leanring-buddy/Info.plist`:

- `WorkerBaseURL` is used for Claude chat (`/chat`) and AssemblyAI token requests (`/transcribe-token`)
- `ElevenLabsWorkerBaseURL` is used for ElevenLabs TTS (`/tts`)

If `ElevenLabsWorkerBaseURL` is missing, it automatically falls back to `WorkerBaseURL`.

### 4. Open in Xcode and run

```bash
open leanring-buddy.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:

1. Select the `leanring-buddy` scheme
2. Set your signing team under Signing & Capabilities
3. Hit **Cmd + R** to build and run

The app will appear in your menu bar (not the dock). Click the icon to open the panel, grant the permissions it asks for, and you're good.

### Permissions the app needs

- **Microphone** — for push-to-talk voice capture
- **Accessibility** — for the global keyboard shortcut (Control + Option)
- **Screen Recording** — for taking screenshots when you use the hotkey
- **Screen Content** — for ScreenCaptureKit access

## Architecture

If you want the full technical breakdown, read `AGENTS.md`. Short version:

Menu bar app (no dock icon) with two `NSPanel` windows — one for the control panel dropdown, one for the full-screen transparent cursor overlay. Push-to-talk streams audio over a websocket to AssemblyAI, sends the transcript + screenshot to Claude via streaming SSE, and plays the response through ElevenLabs TTS. Claude can embed `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]` tags in its responses to make the cursor fly to specific UI elements across multiple monitors. All three APIs are proxied through a Cloudflare Worker.
